## üì¶ Packaging Instructions

Follow these steps to package/build the Python script into an executable using **PyInstaller**:

1. **Extract ZIP**  
   Extract the downloaded ZIP file into a directory of your choice.

2. **Install PyInstaller**  
   Open a terminal/command prompt and install PyInstaller (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

3. **Build Using the `.spec` File**
   (skip this if you want to do it manually)
   
   Use the provided `.spec` file to replicate the exact settings used during development, run:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller Hardware_Information.spec
   ```
   
   This will generate the executable in the `dist/` folder, using the configurations from the `.spec` file.

4. **Build Without the `.spec` File** -#
   If you prefer to compile manually, run:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile Hardware_Information.py
   ```
   - `--onefile`: Combines all dependencies into a single executable.  

5. **Locate the Executable**  
   After packaging, the executable (`Hardware_Information.exe`) will be located in the `dist/` directory.


- **Why** should I build it by using the provided `.spec` file?

- `.spec` is a file that stores all the settings used during development packaging, meaning this is how the executable in releases was built, however, as the user, you are free to do whatever.
